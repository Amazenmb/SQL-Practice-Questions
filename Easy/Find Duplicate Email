Please provide an SQL query to generate a report of duplicate emails. It can be assumed that the email field will
always have a value, and the resulting table can be in any order.

**Schema**
Table Name: Person
Name	          Type
id	          INTEGER
email	          TEXT

**Solution**

SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(id)>1
