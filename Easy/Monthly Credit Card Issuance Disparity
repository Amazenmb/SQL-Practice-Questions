Your team at Citibank is gearing up to launch a new credit card, and in preparation, you're conducting an analysis to understand the monthly
issuance patterns for each credit card. Write a query to display the name of each credit card and the difference in the number of cards issued between 
the month with the highest issuance and the lowest issuance. Arrange the results based on the largest disparity.

Table Name: monthly_cards_issued
Name	Type
issue_month	INTEGER
issue_year	INTEGER
card_name	TEXT
issued_amount	INTEGER

**Solution**
SELECT card_name, MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount) AS difference
FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY card_name
ORDER BY difference DESC
