Query: Engagement is crucial for any platform's success. Your task is to analyze user engagement data stored in a database and identify users who consistently interact with the platform.

Specifically, you'll need to determine which users have more than one session and maintain an average session duration > 5

Round off average session duration to 1 decimal point.

**Schema**

Table Name: sessions
Name	Type
id	INTEGER
userid	INTEGER
duration	NUMERIC

**Solution**

ELECT userid, ROUND(AVG(duration),1) AS avg_duration
FROM sessions 
GROUP BY userid
HAVING COUNT(id)>1
AND avg_duration>5
