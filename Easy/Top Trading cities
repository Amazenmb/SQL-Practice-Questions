Q. Assuming you have access to the tables containing information about completed trade orders (trades) and user details (users) in a Robinhood trading system,
your task is to create a query that retrieves the top three cities with the highest number of completed trade orders, listed in descending order. The output 
should display the city name and the corresponding total number of completed trade orders.

Schema: 
Table Name: trades
Name	Type
order_id	INTEGER
user_id	INTEGER
price	FLOAT
quantity	INTEGER
status	TEXT
timestamp	DATE_TIME
Table Name: users
Name	Type
user_id	INTEGER
city	TEXT
email	TEXT
signup_date	DATE_TIME


Soln.
SELECT u.city, COUNT(t.order_id) aS total_orders
FROM trades as t 
JOIN users as u 
ON t.user_id=u.user_id
WHERE status="Completed"
GROUP BY u.city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 3
