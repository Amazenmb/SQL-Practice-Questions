Query: Write a SQL query to find the top 3 teams that have achieved the highest number of wins with the lowest budget. The "win-to-budget ratio"
is calculated as the number of wins divided by the budget, scaled by a factor of 1,000,000, and rounded to two decimal places. Show the team name, 
number of wins, and their budget, sorted by the best win-to-budget ratio.

Expected Output: A table with team names, number of wins, and their budget, sorted by the best win-to-budget ratio.

**Schema**

Table Name: teams
Name	            Type
team_id        	INTEGER
team_name        	TEXT
wins	          INTEGER
losses	        INTEGER
draws	          INTEGER
league_position	INTEGER
budget	          FLOAT

**Solution**

SELECT team_name,  wins, budget,  ROUND((wins*1000000.0)/budget,2) as win_to_budget_ratio
FROM teams
ORDER BY win_to_budget_ratio DESC
LIMIT 3
