In a university, there is a database table named Teacher that stores information about the subjects taught by each teacher. The table has columns teacher_id, subject_id, and dept_id, where each row represents a teacher teaching a particular subject in a specific department.

Write an SQL query to determine the count of unique subjects taught by each teacher.

**Schema**
Table Name: Teacher
Name	Type
teacher_id	INTEGER
subject_id	INTEGER
dept_id	INTEGER

**Solution**
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id
