Suppose you have an events table in the Facebook app analytics database. Write an SQL query to compute the click-through rate (CTR) for each app in the year 2022, rounding the results to 1 decimal places.

Definition and Note:

Click-through Rate (CTR) is calculated using the formula:

CTR=100.0Ã—Number of Clicks/Number of Impressions

To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

In the event of no impressions being present, return 0.0

**Schema**
Table Name: events
Name	Type
app_id	INTEGER
event_type	TEXT
timestamp	DATE_TIME

**Solution**
SELECT app_id, COALESCE(ROUND(100.0 *
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
    NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0.0 END), 0.0), 1), 0.0) AS ctr
FROM events
WHERE strftime('%Y',timestamp)='2022'
GROUP BY app_id
