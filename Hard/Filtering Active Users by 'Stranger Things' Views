You are tasked with identifying Netflix users who have recently engaged with the show "Stranger Things" and are currently active subscribers. You are provided 
with the following database structure, which includes information about users, their viewing history, and the shows they have watched.

Write a SQL query to retrieve all active users who have watched more than 10 episodes of the show "Stranger Things" within the last 30 days.

Expected Output: The query should return a list of user IDs (user_id) and the number of episodes (episodes_watched) of "Stranger Things" they have watched 
in the last 30 days, where the number of episodes is greater than 10.

**Schema**
Table Name: users
Name	Type
user_id	INTEGER
active	INTEGER

Table Name: shows
Name	Type
show_id	INTEGER
show_name	TEXT

Table Name: viewing_history
Name	Type
user_id	INTEGER
show_id	INTEGER
episode_id	INTEGER
watch_date	TEXT

**Solution**
SELECT u.user_id, COUNT(v.episode_id) AS episodes_watched
FROM users AS u 
    INNER JOIN viewing_history AS v 
    ON u.user_id=v.user_id
INNER JOIN shows AS s 
ON v.show_id=s.show_id
WHERE s.show_name='Stranger Things'
    AND watch_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'

GROUP BY v.user_id
HAVING COUNT(episode_id)>10
