For a given table containing Facebook posts, your task is to create a query that identifies users who posted at least twice in the year 2021. For each such user, 
find the number of days between their first and last post within that year. Output the user_id along with the corresponding number of days between the first and 
last post for each qualifying user.

**Schema**
Table Name: posts
Name	Type
user_id	INTEGER
post_id	INTEGER
post_date	DATE_TIME
post_content	TEXT

**Solution**
SELECT 
	user_id, 
    CAST(ROUND(MAX(julianday(post_date)) - MIN(julianday(post_date))) AS INTEGER) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE strftime('%Y', post_date) = '2021'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(post_id)>1;
