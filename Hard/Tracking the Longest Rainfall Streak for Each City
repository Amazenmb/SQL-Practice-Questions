You are given a dataset rainfall_records that tracks daily rainfall data across multiple cities.Your task is to find
the longest consecutive streak of days with non-zero rainfall for each city sorted by city_id. A streak is defined as 
consecutive days where rainfall_mm > 0, and the longest streak should be determined separately for each city.

**Schema**

Table Name: rainfall_records
Name	Type
city_id	INTEGER
record_date	DATE
rainfall_mm	FLOAT

**Solution**
WITH streaks AS (
    SELECT city_id, record_date,
           rainfall_mm > 0 AS is_raining,
           SUM(CASE WHEN rainfall_mm > 0 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) OVER (PARTITION BY city_id ORDER BY record_date) AS streak_group
    FROM rainfall_records
),
grouped_streaks AS (
    SELECT city_id, streak_group, COUNT(*) AS streak_length
    FROM streaks
    WHERE is_raining
    GROUP BY city_id, streak_group
)
