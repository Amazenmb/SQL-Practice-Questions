Please create an SQL query to identify the employees who are high earners in each department of the company. A high earner is defined as an employee whose salary ranks within the top three
unique salaries for their respective department.

Schema:

Table Name: Employee
Name	Type
id	INTEGER
name	TEXT
salary	INTEGER
departmentId	INTEGER
Table Name: Department
Name	Type
id	INTEGER
name	TEXT

Soln.

Method 1:
WITH DistinctSalaries AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        e.salary,
        e.departmentId
    FROM
        Employee e
),
TopSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        ds.salary,
        ds.departmentId,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ds.departmentId ORDER BY ds.salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM
        DistinctSalaries ds
)
SELECT 
    d.name AS Department,
    e.name AS Employee,
    e.salary aS Salary
FROM 
    Employee e
JOIN 
    Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
JOIN 
    TopSalaries ts ON e.salary = ts.salary AND e.departmentId = ts.departmentId
WHERE 
    ts.salary_rank <= 3
ORDER BY 
    d.name, e.salary DESC;

Method 2:

SELECT
    d.Name AS 'Department', e1.Name AS 'Employee', e1.Salary AS 'Salary'
FROM
    Employee e1
        JOIN
    Department d ON e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE
    3 > (SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
        FROM
            Employee e2
        WHERE
            e2.Salary > e1.Salary
                AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
        )
ORDER BY Department ASC, SALARY DESC;
