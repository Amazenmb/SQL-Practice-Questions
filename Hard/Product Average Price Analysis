You are given two tables, Prices and UnitsSold, containing data about product prices and units sold respectively. The Prices table includes the product ID, start date, end date, and price of each product over specific periods. The UnitsSold table records the product ID, purchase date, and units sold for each transaction.

Write an SQL query to calculate the average selling price for each product, rounded to 1 decimal places. Order the results by product id

**Schema**

Table Name: Prices
Name	Type
product_id	INTEGER
start_date	DATE
end_date	DATE
price	INTEGER

Table Name: UnitsSold
Name	Type
product_id	INTEGER
purchase_date	DATE
units	INTEGER

**Solution**
SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(p.price*u.units)/SUM(u.units),1),0) AS average_price
FROM Prices AS p 
INNER JOIN UnitsSold AS u 
ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id
Order by p.product_id
