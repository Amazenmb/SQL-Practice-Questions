Calculate the conversion rate (conversion_rate) from 'view' to 'purchase' for each user. The conversion rate is defined as the percentage of users who have viewed at least one product and subsequently made a purchase, relative to all users who have viewed a product. The formula for the conversion rate is:

conversion_rate = (number_of_users_who_made_a_purchase / number_of_users_who_viewed_at_least_one_product) * 100
The final conversion rate should be rounded to one decimal place

**Schema**
Table Name: user_activity
Name	Type
session_id	INTEGER
user_id	INTEGER
event_type	TEXT
event_timestamp	DATE_TIME

**Solution**

WITH viewed_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id
    FROM user_activity
    WHERE event_type = 'view'
),
purchased_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id
    FROM user_activity
    WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
)
SELECT 
    ROUND((CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT pu.user_id) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(DISTINCT vu.user_id)) * 100, 2) AS conversion_rate
FROM viewed_users vu
LEFT JOIN purchased_users pu ON vu.user_id = pu.user_id;
