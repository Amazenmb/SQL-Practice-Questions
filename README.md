# SQL-Questions


Hey, I have curated a list of common SQL questions for practising. It is helpful to those who are trying to learn about SQL and those who want to practise for interviews, tests, etc.
The questions are categorized into Easy, Medium and Hard, so one can start with Easy to build momentum and then proceed to Medium or Hard category to test their SQL skills.
