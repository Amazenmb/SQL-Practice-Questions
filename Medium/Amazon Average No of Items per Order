You are tasked with determining the mean number of items per order on Amazon, rounded to 1 decimal place. The information is stored in two tables - items_per_order
and order_occurrences, containing details about the count of items in each order and the corresponding number of orders for each item count.

**Schema**
Table Name: items_per_order
Name	Type
item_count	INTEGER
order_occurrences	INTEGER

**Solution**

SELECT ROUND(1.0*SUM(item_count*order_occurrences)/SUM(order_occurrences),1) AS mean
FROM items_per_order
