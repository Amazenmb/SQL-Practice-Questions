Given a table User_Activity_Log containing user activities on a social media website, find the count of active users for each day over the past 30 days 
until the date 2024-01-26 inclusively. A user is considered active on a particular day if they have performed at least one activity on that day.

*Schema**
Table Name: User_Activity_Log
Name	Type
user_id	INTEGER
session_id	INTEGER
activity_date	DATE
activity_type	TEXT

**Solution**
SELECT activity_date as day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM User_Activity_Log
    WHERE activity_date <='2024-01-26'
GROUP BY activity_date
