Query: Given the reviews table, create a SQL query to fetch the average star rating for each product, grouped by month. The output should present the month as a 
numeric value, the product ID, and the average star rating rounded to one decimal place. Ensure the output is sorted by month and then by product ID.

**Schema**

Table Name: reviews
Name	Type
review_id	INTEGER
user_id	INTEGER
submit_date	DATE_TIME
product_id	INTEGER
stars	INTEGER

**Solution**
SELECT
    CAST(strftime('%m', submit_date) AS INTEGER) AS mth, product_id AS product, ROUND(AVG(stars),1) AS avg_stars
FROM reviews
GROUP BY mth, product_id
ORDER BY mth, product_id
