You're managing a database of employee salaries at a large corporation. Unfortunately, the data contains outdated salary information for some employees.
To ensure everyone receives fair and accurate compensation, you need to update these salaries based on the company's annual raise policy.

**Schema**
Table Name: ms_employee_salary
Name	Type
id	INTEGER
first_name	TEXT
last_name	TEXT
department_id	INTEGER
salary	INTEGER

**Solution**
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, department_id, MAX(salary) as current_salary
FROM ms_employee_salary
    GROUP BY id
ORDER BY id
