We aim to analyze the review scores for the renowned movie "The Matrix" on a movie review platform.

Given a table containing movie reviews, write an SQL query to determine the count of reviews for each rating score received by "The Matrix".

The output should include the movie title, rating score, and the number of reviews with that score.

**Schema**

FROM movie_reviews
    WHERE movie_title='The Matrix'
GROUP BY rating_score
